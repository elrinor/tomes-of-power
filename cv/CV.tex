    %\section{\mysidestyle Personal\\Statement}
    %I strive for excellence in everything that I do. 
    %Software development is my passion, and I take great enjoyment in creating software that has a positive impact on the lives of others. 
    %I like communicating with people and don't shy away from tasks that do not involve writing code, be it helping junior developers to grow professionally or discussing feature requests with a client.

    %I stand out from my peers, even in highly competitive environments. 
    %I was in top 1\% at the university, and currently I'm the most knowledgeable C++/Qt expert at Network Optix.
    %When I came to MSU I was just another student from a small city somewhere in central Russia. At the time of graduation, I was among the top 1\%. 
    %When I have joined Network Optix I was significantly younger than all other members of the team and had much less experience, but I have caught up quickly and soon became the most knowledgeable C++/Qt expert in the company.
    
    %I perform well under pressure. 
    %At Network Optix I have almost single-handedly implemented the first version of the client application in a very limited time, basically making it possible to release the software before an important trade show.

    %I'll be happy to join a team of similarly self-motivated and highly competent professionals in a company with ambitious and far-reaching goals.
    
    %Bla bla bla.

    \textbf{Yandex}, Moscow, Russian Federation \vspace{2mm}\\\vspace{1mm}%
    \textsl{Head of Search Components} \hfill \textbf{October 2015 - present}\\\vspace{1mm}%
    \textsl{Senior Search Engineer} \hfill \textbf{October 2014 - October 2015}\\
    Currently responsible for Yandex search runtime, managing a team of some 20 developers.
    
    Was hired as an engineer to work on the next generation index that would speed up the search process. The scope of the project was subsequently expanded to what effectively amounts to rewriting most of the search runtime. Wrote most of the index i/o and runtime code, and successfully deployed it in several search verticals, resulting in significant performance and quality gains. Currently working on dropping most of the legacy code and unifying our runtime using the newly developed technologies, with a goal of significantly growing our search database.
    
    As a side project have started an effort to revitalize our code base, replacing dated code and generally bringing order to where chaos has previously reigned. Ported clang's libcxx to MSVC as part of this effort, thus being instrumental in our switch to C++11 STL.

    Also currently leading a project to improve the way programming interviews are performed at Yandex. Started with a number of presentations on best interviewing practices for different branches of the company, then worked on developing new rules for our interviewing process. Was subsequently charged with implementing these rules on the company scale. Did a lot of research into what constituted a good interview, gathered a team of skilled interviewers, organized interviewing training for employees, and optimized the interviewing process in a manner that was both transparent for all parties involved and was meeting our KPIs.

    \textsl{Senior Software Engineer} \hfill \textbf{October 2011 - July 2014}\\ 
    Designed and implemented initial version of the HD Witness client application, making sure that its high-level architecture is sound and extensible. As of 2016, five years down the road, most of the foundational code is still unchanged, with a bunch of features added on top.
    
    As the person solely responsible for the client-facing part of the system, I made no compromises when it came to delivering the best experience for our users. After 1.0 release various sources have described HD Witness as the most user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing video management system on the market, which has helped the company to gain a competitive edge.
    
    Was subsequently charged with management of the front-end development team. Other responsibilities included design of public APIs and development of generic C++ libraries that were used internally.
    
    %Streamlined the UI making it highly intuitive and utilized OpenGL to provide a fluid and visually appealing user experience. 
    
    %Was subsequently responsible for development of generic C++ libraries that were used internally, including compile-time reflection for C++ types, data serialization and object-relational mapping. Other responsibilities included design of public APIs, management of the front-end development team and ensuring UI and UX consistency of our desktop and mobile clients.

    %\textsl{Software Development Lead, Co-founder} \hfill \textbf{June 2010 - October 2011}\\
    %Combild was started to create an IT service management (ITSM) system that would target small companies and IT outsourcers, an underserved market niche for which competing solutions were either too expensive or excessively complex. Combild was to offer a lightweight and user-friendly ITSM system with a licensing model specifically targeted at small companies and IT oursourcers.

    %At the time all other solutions on the market were either too bulky and hard to maintain, or were not suitable for the business model of IT outsourcers. Frustrated with the state of things, we have decided to roll out our own product.

    %My role was to lay out the initial product architecture, to implement the first demonstrable version, and then to work with customers to prioritize and clarify the features and to manage a small development team. 
    %The system was developed in C++/Qt and targeted both Windows and Linux.
    
    %After a year of development we have secured our first customers, but at that point the cash inflow we had wasn't sufficient to cover our expenses. Unable to secure the funding, we had to close the project.

    
    \textbf{Select LTD}, Moscow, Russian Federation \vspace{2mm}\\\vspace{1mm}%
    \textsl{Software Engineer} \hfill \textbf{July 2009 - September 2011}\\
    Was mainly working on SmartDec, a native code decompiler. Laid out the architecture of the decompiler and implemented several frontend and backend plugins, including support for different x86 and PIC assembly input formats. Was responsible for devising novel algorithms that would improve the quality of the decompiled code and would allow for reconstruction of C++-specific constructs. This effort has led to several publications on international conferences on reverse engineering. Detailed description of the decompiler is available at \url{http://decompilation.info}.

    Have also implemented a form recognition toolkit that was subsequently used in some of the Moscow schools for test checking. 
    %Detailed description is available at \url{http://elric.ru/wordpress/projects/form-recognition-toolkit/}. 

    Was additionally working on \url{http://mathege.ru}, a national mathematics exam portal developed in Java using Apache Struts web framework. Did both frontend and backend development and have implemented a \LaTeX~to html converter that was used for importing problems into the system.
