    \section{\mysidestyle Personal\\Statement}
    I strive for excellence in everything that I do. 
    Software development is my passion, and I take great enjoyment in creating software that has a positive impact on the lives of others. 
    %I enjoy communicating with people and don't shy away from tasks that do not involve writing code, be it helping junior developers to grow professionally or discussing feature requests with a client.

    I stand out from my peers, even in highly competitive environments. 
    I was in top 1\% at the university, and currently I'm the most knowledgeable C++/Qt expert at Network Optix.
    %When I came to MSU I was just another student from a small city somewhere in central Russia. At the time of graduation, I was among the top 1\%. 
    %When I have joined Network Optix I was significantly younger than all other members of the team and had much less experience, but I have caught up quickly and soon became the most knowledgeable C++/Qt expert in the company.
    
    I perform well under pressure. 
    At Network Optix I have almost single-handedly implemented the first version of the client application in a very limited time, basically making it possible to release the software before an important trade show.

    I'll be happy to join a team of similarly self-motivated and highly competent professionals in a company with ambitious and far-reaching goals.

    \section{\mysidestyle Professional\\Experience}
    \textbf{Network Optix, Inc.} \vspace{2mm}\\\vspace{1mm}%
    \textsl{Senior Software Engineer} \hfill \textbf{October 2011 - present}\\
    I'm currently working on HD Witness, an Enterprise Video Management System (VMS). 
    
    For the initial release I have almost single-handedly implemented the client application which was very well received in the industry. Various sources have described HD Witness as the most visually appealing and user-friendly VMS on the market, which has helped the company to gain a competitive edge.
    
    Currently my main responsibilities include ensuring UI and UX performance and consistency of our desktop and mobile clients, management of the front-end development team, design of public APIs and development of generic C++ libraries that are used internally.

    
	\textbf{Combild} \vspace{2mm}\\\vspace{1mm}%
	\textsl{Software Development Lead, Co-founder} \hfill \textbf{June 2010 - December 2011}\\
    Combild was started to create a program complex for IT infrastructure management that would target small companies and IT outsourcers. At the time all other solutions on the market were either too bulky and hard to maintain, or were not suitable for the business model of IT outsourcers. Frustrated with the state of things, we have decided to roll out our own product.
    
    At Combild I have laid out the initial product architecture, was working with customers to prioritize and clarify the features and was managing a small development team.
    
    %After a year of development we have secured our first customers, but at that point the cash inflow we had wasn't sufficient to cover our expenses. Unable to secure the funding, we had to close the project.

    
    \textbf{Select LTD} \vspace{2mm}\\\vspace{1mm}%
    \textsl{Software Engineer} \hfill \textbf{July 2009 - September 2011}\\
    At Select LTD I was mainly working on SmartDec, a native code decompiler. I have laid out the architecture of the decompiler and have implemented several frontend and backend plugins, including support for different x86 and PIC assembly input formats. I was also responsible for devising novel algorithms that would improve the quality of the decompiled code and would allow for reconstruction of C++-specific constructs. This effort has lead to several publications on international conferences on reverse engineering. Detailed description of the decompiler is available at \url{http://decompilation.info}.
    
    As one of the side projects at Select LTD I have implemented a form recognition toolkit that was subsequently used in some of the Moscow schools for test checking. I have also participated in the development of business processes and supporting infrastructure for this project. Detailed description is available at \url{http://elric.ru/wordpress/projects/form-recognition-toolkit/}. 

    \pagebreak    

    I was also doing some work on \url{http://mathege.ru}, a portal for national mathematics exam in Russia. I did both frontend and backend development and have implemented a \LaTeX~to html converter that was used for importing problems into the system.

    \textsl{Software Engineer} \hfill \textbf{September 2007 - September 2008}\\
    At ISPRAS I was working in a team developing a framework for dynamic analysis of binary code. Using C++ metaprogramming techniques I have implemented a disassembler for MIPS64 architecture that significantly outperformed all other disassemblers for this architecture known to our team.

    \textsl{Software Engineer} \hfill \textbf{February 2007 - April 2008}\\
    At Intel Lab I was learning computer vision algorithms and have implemented a panorama stitching application. Description is available at \url{https://code.google.com/p/prec/}.

    As a side project I have implemented Ruby bindings for Intel's Integrated Performance Primitives library. Description is available at \url{https://code.google.com/p/ipp4r/}.
    
    
	\textbf{Personal Projects} \vspace{2mm}\\\vspace{1mm}%
    I am an avid programmer and I enjoy writing code in my free time. Throughout the years I have done a lot freelance work and have finished several personal projects.
