    %\section{\mysidestyle Personal\\Statement}
    %I strive for excellence in everything that I do. 
    %Software development is my passion, and I take great enjoyment in creating software that has a positive impact on the lives of others. 
    %I like communicating with people and don't shy away from tasks that do not involve writing code, be it helping junior developers to grow professionally or discussing feature requests with a client.

    %I stand out from my peers, even in highly competitive environments. 
    %I was in top 1\% at the university, and currently I'm the most knowledgeable C++/Qt expert at Network Optix.
    %When I came to MSU I was just another student from a small city somewhere in central Russia. At the time of graduation, I was among the top 1\%. 
    %When I have joined Network Optix I was significantly younger than all other members of the team and had much less experience, but I have caught up quickly and soon became the most knowledgeable C++/Qt expert in the company.
    
    %I perform well under pressure. 
    %At Network Optix I have almost single-handedly implemented the first version of the client application in a very limited time, basically making it possible to release the software before an important trade show.

    %I'll be happy to join a team of similarly self-motivated and highly competent professionals in a company with ambitious and far-reaching goals.
    
    %I'm looking for a job in a company that has a visible impact and

    \textbf{Network Optix, Inc.} \vspace{2mm}\\\vspace{1mm}%
    \textsl{Senior Software Engineer} \hfill \textbf{October 2011 - present}\\ 
	Implemented initial version of the HD Witness client application. Streamlined the UI making it highly intuitive and utilized OpenGL to provide a fluid and visually appealing user experience. Various sources have described HD Witness as the most aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly video management system on the market, which has helped the company to gain a competitive edge.
    
    Currently responsible for development of generic C++ libraries that are used internally, including compile-time reflection for C++ types, data serialization and object-relational mapping. Other responsibilities include design of public APIs and ensuring UI and UX consistency of our desktop and mobile clients.

    
	\textbf{Combild} \vspace{2mm}\\\vspace{1mm}%
	\textsl{Software Development Lead, Co-founder} \hfill \textbf{June 2010 - December 2011}\\	
	Combild was started to create an IT service management (ITSM) system that would target small companies and IT outsourcers, an underserved market niche for which competing solutions such as 1C:ITIL and Itilium were either too expensive or excessively complex. Combild was to offer a lightweight and user-friendly ITSM system with a licensing model specifically targeted at small companies and IT oursourcers.

	%At the time all other solutions on the market were either too bulky and hard to maintain, or were not suitable for the business model of IT outsourcers. Frustrated with the state of things, we have decided to roll out our own product.
	
    My role was to lay out the initial product architecture and to implement the first demonstrable version, and then to work with customers to prioritize and clarify the features and to manage a small development team. 
	%The system was developed in C++/Qt and targeted both Windows and Linux.
    
    %After a year of development we have secured our first customers, but at that point the cash inflow we had wasn't sufficient to cover our expenses. Unable to secure the funding, we had to close the project.

    
    \textbf{Select LTD} \vspace{2mm}\\\vspace{1mm}%
    \textsl{Software Engineer} \hfill \textbf{July 2009 - September 2011}\\
    Was mainly working on SmartDec, a native code decompiler. Laid out the architecture of the decompiler and implemented several frontend and backend plugins, including support for different x86 and PIC assembly input formats. Was responsible for devising novel algorithms that would improve the quality of the decompiled code and would allow for reconstruction of C++-specific constructs. This effort has lead to several publications on international conferences on reverse engineering. Detailed description of the decompiler is available at \url{http://decompilation.info}.
    
    Have also implemented a form recognition toolkit that was subsequently used in some of the Moscow schools for test checking. Detailed description is available at \url{http://elric.ru/wordpress/projects/form-recognition-toolkit/}. 

    Was additionally working on \url{http://mathege.ru}, a national mathematics exam portal developed in Java using Apache Struts web framework. Did both frontend and backend development and have implemented a \LaTeX~to html converter that was used for importing problems into the system.

    \textsl{Software Engineer} \hfill \textbf{September 2007 - September 2008}\\
    Was working in a team developing a framework for dynamic analysis of binary code. Using C++ metaprogramming techniques implemented a disassembler for MIPS64 architecture that significantly outperformed all other disassemblers for this architecture known to our team.

	\textbf{Personal Projects} \vspace{2mm}\\\vspace{1mm}%
    I am an avid programmer and I enjoy writing code in my free time. Throughout the years I have done a lot freelance work and have finished several personal projects, including a real-time ray-tracing engine, a virtual mouse driver for Windows XP, a tool for automatic reconstruction of 3d solids from engineering drawings and a lot of OpenGL demos.
