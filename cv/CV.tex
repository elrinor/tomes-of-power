    I was working on a program complex for IT infrastructure management that targeted small companies and IT outsourcers. I was responsible for the overall product architecture and was managing a small development team. After a year of development we have secured our first customers, but at that point the cash inflow we had wasn't sufficient to cover our expenses. Unable to secure the funding, we had to close the project.

    I'm currently working on HD Witness, an Enterprise Video Management System (VMS). 
    
    For the initial release I have almost single-handedly implemented the client application that was very well received in the industry. Various sources have described HD Witness as the most visually appealing and user-friendly VMS on the market. 
    
    Currently my main responsibilities include ensuring UI and UX performance and consistency of our desktop and mobile clients, management of the front-end development team, design of public APIs and development of generic C++ libraries that are used internally.
